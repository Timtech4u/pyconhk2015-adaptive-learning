Building an Adaptive Learning System using Bayesian Modelling in Python
=======================================================================
This repository contains the materials used in the presentation at the PyCon HK 2015 (http://2015.pycon.hk/).
The presentation introduces how to implement an adaptive learning system using Bayesian modelling in Python.

Tools Introduced
================
* PyMC: https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc 

Adaptive Learning in Action
===========================
Our "Learn Katakana" App makes use of Bayesian modelling to help users to learn Japanese Katakana effectively. It is freely available on both Android and iOS:
